**Lab 2**

**Part I (30 points)**

In this part, you will write a program which involves implementation of the following two functions.

**void readInput(int arr[], int \*nPtr);** /\* reads numbers from the standard input
into arr, and stores the number of elements read in the memory cell pointed
to by nPtr \*/

**void printNumbers(const int arr[], int n);** /\* prints the elements in arr[0..(n-1)] \*/

First, define a constant macro named SIZEwith the value 1000.

In main function, you will create an array and print the elements of the array as follows:

路 Define an integer array with the size SIZE

路 Call readInputfunction

路 In the readInputfunction,
o First, read number of elements into the memory cell pointed by nPtr.

o Then, read elements into arr.

路 Call printNumbersfunction for printing the array elements.

**Sample Run:**

> Enter the number of elements:

>  *5*

> Enter 5 elements:

> *1 2 3 4 5*

> Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5
> 

**Part II (35 points)**

Your task in this part is to fill in the missing function definitions in skeleton code **lab2part2.c**. You will use the same readInputand printNumbersfunctions from part I. **main** function will stay as it is.

Implement the following function in skeleton code **lab2part2.c**:

// Precondition: Let n represent number of elements in arr.

/\* Finds the minimum element of the arr and stores it in the memory cell

pointed to by minPtr. \*/

/\* Finds the maximum element of the arr and stores it in the memory cell

pointed to by maxPtr. \*/

void findMinMax(const int arr[], int n, int \*minPtr, int \*maxPtr);


**Sample Run:**

> Enter the number of elements:

> *9*

> Enter 9 elements:

> *1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9*

> Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

> Minimum of array is: 1

> Maximum of array is: 9


**Part III (35 points)**

Your task in this part is to fill in the missing function definitions in skeleton code **lab2part3.c**. You will use the same readInputand printNumbersfunctions from part I. **main** function will stay as it is.

Implement the following function in skeleton code **lab2part3.c**:

// Precondition: Let n represent number of elements in arr.

/\* Finds all the leaders in arr and stores into leadersArr and number of

elements in leadersArr is stored in the memory cell pointed to by sp. \*/

/\* An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right

side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. \*/

void findLeaders(const int arr[], int n, int leadersArr[], int \*sp);


**Sample Run:**

> Enter the number of elements:

> *6*

> Enter 6 elements:

> *6 7 4 3 5 2*

> Array elements: 6 7 4 3 5 2

> Leaders Array elements: 2 5 7
